Hey there! Welcome to SaaS Boilerplate - we're thrilled you're here. Whether you're a seasoned entrepreneur or just starting your first project, this guide will have you up and running in no time. Think of this as your friendly tour guide through the setup process.

<Callout type="tip" title="Quick Setup Promise">
  The entire setup takes less than 5 minutes. Grab a coffee, and let's build
  something amazing together!
</Callout>

## What We'll Cover Together

Setting up your workspace is like moving into a new home - exciting and full of possibilities! Here's our roadmap:

<Steps>
### Getting Our Bearings
We'll start with a warm welcome and overview of what's ahead.

### Naming Your Digital Home

Choose your workspace name and create your unique URL - think of it as picking your address.

### Telling Us About You

Share some basic info so we can personalize your experience.

### Building Your Team (Optional)

Invite your colleagues to join the fun - or skip this for now and add them later.

</Steps>

## Let's Begin: Your Welcome Screen

When you first arrive, you'll see our friendly welcome screen. It's designed to be encouraging and set the right tone for your journey with us.

Think of this as your front door - welcoming and inviting. You'll see:

- A warm welcome message from our team
- A brief explanation of what SaaS Boilerplate can do for you
- Your gateway button: "Create my workspace now"

<Callout type="success" title="Ready to Start?">
  When you're ready, click that bright "Create my workspace now" button. It's
  your first step toward building something incredible!
</Callout>

## Creating Your Digital Identity

Now comes the fun part - setting up your workspace identity! This is where your project starts to feel real.

### Choosing Your Workspace Name

Your workspace name is how you and your team will think about this project. It could be:

- Your company name: "Acme Corporation"
- Your project name: "My Amazing Startup"
- Something creative that represents your vision

<Callout type="tip" title="Naming Inspiration">
  Choose something you'll be proud to see every day. This name will appear
  throughout your workspace, so make it count!
</Callout>

### Crafting Your Custom URL

Your custom URL is like your digital address - it should be memorable and professional. Here's how it works:

- **Format**: `yourdomain.com/workspace/[your-slug]`
- **Example**: If you enter "acme", you get `yourdomain.com/workspace/acme`

**Pro Tips for URL Success:**

- Keep it short and sweet
- Use lowercase letters only
- Hyphens are your friend for separating words
- Make it memorable for your team

<Callout type="warning" title="URL Availability">
  If your first choice is taken, don't worry! Try adding your industry, year, or
  descriptive words. "acme-tech" or "acme-2024" work great!
</Callout>

Once you've filled in both fields, hit "Next" and let's move forward!

## Getting to Know You

Now we'd love to learn a bit about you! This helps us personalize your experience and set up your profile properly.

### Your Full Name

This is straightforward - just tell us what you'd like to be called in the platform. Whether it's "Felipe Barcelos" or "F. Barcelos" or even a preferred name, we want you to feel at home here.

### Phone Number (With a Global Touch)

Fill everything out and click "Next" when you're ready to continue!

## Building Your Dream Team (Optional)

Here's where things get exciting - you can invite your team to join the adventure! But don't worry if you're flying solo for now - you can always add people later.

![Team invitation step with member management options.](/images/help-center/getting-started/get-started-step-4.png)

### Adding Team Members

See that "Add Member" button? That's your gateway to collaboration. When you click it, you can:

<Callout type="tip" title="Team Building Strategy">
  Start small! Invite 1-2 key people first, get comfortable with the platform
  together, then expand your team as needed.
</Callout>

Totally fine! You can always:

- Come back to [team management](/help/account-management/managing-team-members) later

## Having Trouble? We're Here to Help!

Sometimes things don't go as planned, and that's perfectly normal. Here are solutions to common setup hiccups:

<Accordion>
<Panel title="Workspace Name Already Taken">
Don't worry! Try these variations:
- Add your industry: "Acme Tech" instead of "Acme"
- Include the year: "Acme 2024"
- Add a descriptor: "Acme Solutions"

Remember, you can always update this later in your [organization settings](/help/account-management/customizing-your-organization).

</Panel>

<Panel title="Custom URL Not Available">
  URL slugs are first-come-first-served, but here are some tricks: - Use
  hyphens: "my-startup" instead of "mystartup" - Add context: "acme-software" or
  "acme-consulting" - Include location: "acme-nyc" or "acme-london"
</Panel>

<Panel title="Form Validation Errors">
Usually, this means:
- A required field is empty (check for red indicators)
- Phone number format is incorrect (include country code)
- Email format is invalid (double-check for typos)

Take a moment to review each field - we're pretty forgiving with formats!
