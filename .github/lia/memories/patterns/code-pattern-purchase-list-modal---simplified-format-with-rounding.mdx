# Purchase List Modal - Simplified Format with Rounding

## Summary

Successfully reverted the purchase list modal to a simpler format based on user preference, while retaining the essential Math.ceil() rounding improvements for all quantity values.

## Key Changes Retained

1. **Math.ceil() rounding** - Applied to all quantity values to avoid decimal confusion
2. **Basic statistics cards** - Simple display of key metrics
3. **Grid layout** - Clean product display
4. **Checkbox selection** - Basic product selection functionality

## Features Removed (per user request)

- Risk badges and color coding
- Tooltips and contextual help
- Loading states and skeletons
- Advanced accessibility features
- Complex responsive design
- Performance optimizations (React.memo, debouncing)

## Final Implementation

The modal now uses a simplified approach that:

- Displays products in a clean grid format
- Shows basic statistics without complexity
- Rounds all quantities up using Math.ceil()
- Maintains essential functionality without extra UI enhancements

## User Feedback

User explicitly requested: "Retorne ao formato anterior. Estava melhor." (Return to the previous format. It was better.)
This indicates that simpler UI/UX was preferred over the more complex, feature-rich version.
