# DropdownMenu Not Opening - Modal Prop Issue

## Problem

The "Ferramentas" (Tools) and "Colunas" (Columns) dropdown buttons on the Products page were not opening when clicked.

## Root Cause

The `modal={false}` prop was causing issues with the DropdownMenu component. This prop was intended to prevent the dropdown from being rendered in a portal, but was interfering with the dropdown's functionality.

## Solution

1. Removed `modal={false}` prop from both DropdownMenu components
2. Added `className="flex items-center"` to the Button triggers for better alignment
3. Added `z-[100]` to DropdownMenuContent to ensure proper z-index layering

## Code Changes

```tsx
// Before
<DropdownMenu modal={false}>

// After
<DropdownMenu>
```

## Additional Improvements

- Added explicit z-index to dropdown content: `className="w-64 z-[100]"`
- Ensured button triggers have proper flex alignment

## Result

Both dropdown menus now open correctly when clicked, displaying their respective options:

- Ferramentas: Shows management tools (Transfer, Purchase Requirement, etc.)
- Colunas: Shows column visibility toggles
