Established a component organization pattern for dashboard pages in Next.js App Router.

Pattern implemented:

- Page-specific components go in: `/app/[page-name]/(components)/`
- The parentheses in "(components)" make it a route group (ignored by Next.js routing)
- Generic/reusable components stay in: `/components/ui/`

Applied to dashboard-vendas:

- Moved `section-cards.tsx` and `chart-area-interactive.tsx` to `/app/dashboard-vendas/(components)/`
- Kept generic `data-table.tsx` in `/components/ui/`

Benefits:

- Clear separation between page-specific and reusable components
- Better code organization and maintainability
- Follows Next.js App Router conventions
