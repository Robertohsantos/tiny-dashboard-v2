# Modal Scroll Header Overlap Fix

## Problem

When scrolling in the purchase list modal, the header (title, filters, search bar) and statistics were overlapping with the product list content.

## Root Cause

The modal structure had the scroll applied to DialogMain but lacked proper flex-shrink-0 on fixed sections, causing them to compress or overlap during scroll.

## Solution Applied

1. Added `flex-shrink-0` to header section to prevent compression
2. Added `flex-shrink-0` to statistics section to keep fixed size
3. Added `flex-shrink-0` to footer section for consistent behavior
4. Updated header row of the table with:
   - `z-20` for higher z-index priority
   - `bg-white` for solid background
   - `border-b` for visual separation

## Code Changes

- Line 195: Added `flex-shrink-0` to header div
- Line 270: Added `flex-shrink-0` to statistics div
- Line 319: Updated table header with `z-20 bg-white border-b`
- Line 360: Added `flex-shrink-0` to footer

## Benefits

- Header and statistics remain visible and fixed at top
- Only the product list scrolls
- No overlapping of elements
- Improved UX with important information always accessible
- Maintains consistent visual structure
