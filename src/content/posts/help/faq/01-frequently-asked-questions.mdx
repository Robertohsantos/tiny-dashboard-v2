## Getting Started Questions

Let's start with the fundamentals - the questions everyone asks when they first discover us:

<Accordion>
<Panel title="What exactly is SaaS Boilerplate?">

Think of SaaS Boilerplate as your all-in-one toolkit for building and running a successful SaaS business! We've taken all the essential features you need - lead management, team collaboration, integrations, billing, form handling - and wrapped them in a beautiful, easy-to-use platform.

Instead of spending months building these systems from scratch (or cobbling together 10 different tools), you get everything in one place. It's like having a Swiss Army knife for SaaS entrepreneurs!

<Card title="Perfect For" icon="Target">
  Startups, growing businesses, and established companies who want to focus on
  their unique value proposition instead of rebuilding the same basic
  infrastructure everyone needs.
</Card>

</Panel>

<Panel title="How quickly can I get up and running?">

Seriously, you can have a functional workspace in under 10 minutes! Here's the beautiful simplicity:

1. **5 minutes**: Complete our [super-friendly setup process](/help/getting-started/first-steps)
2. **3 minutes**: Customize your [organization branding](/help/account-management/customizing-your-organization)
3. **2 minutes**: [Invite your first team member](/help/account-management/managing-team-members)

And voil√† - you're not just signed up, you're actually _using_ the platform productively!

</Panel>

<Panel title="Is there really a free option?">

Absolutely! We believe in letting you experience the magic before making any commitments. Our free tier isn't some stripped-down tease - it's a genuine way to explore the platform and see if it fits your workflow.

- **Free tier**: Perfect for solo entrepreneurs and small teams getting started
- **Paid plans**: When you're ready to scale with more team members and advanced features
- **No pressure**: Upgrade when it makes sense for your growth, not because of artificial limitations

Check out our [billing guide](/help/billing/managing-billing) to see all the options and find your perfect fit!

## Workspace & Team Magic

The fun stuff about making your workspace feel like home and building your dream team:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Making It Yours">

**"How do I make this workspace actually feel like mine?"**

Great question! Your workspace should reflect your personality and brand. Head to `Settings > Organization > Information` and you'll find your customization playground:

- **Upload your logo**: Make it instantly recognizable as _your_ space
- **Name your organization**: Whether it's "Acme Corp" or "Sarah's Startup Dreams"
- **Connect your social profiles**: Show off your professional presence
- **Choose your colors**: (Coming soon - because we know branding matters!)

Check out our [complete branding guide](/help/account-management/customizing-your-organization) for all the creative details!

</Tab>

<Tab title="Building Your Team">

**"Can I actually invite real people to work with me?"**

Of course! Building great things requires great people. Here's how simple team building works:

1. **Find the invite button**: It's in your [team management area](/help/account-management/managing-team-members)
2. **Add their email**: We'll send them a beautiful, professional invitation
3. **Choose their role**: Owner, Admin, or Member - each with appropriate permissions
4. **Welcome them aboard**: They'll get instant access to collaborate

The best part? They'll get a warm welcome email that makes them excited to join your project!

</Tab>

<Tab title="Managing Access">

**"How do I make sure the right people have the right access?"**

Smart question! Security and organization go hand in hand. Here's our simple role system:

- **Owner** (you!): Full control over everything, including billing and organization settings
- **Admin**: Your trusted lieutenants who can manage the team and most settings
- **Member**: Contributors who can access all the tools but can't change organizational stuff

You can change anyone's role anytime, and everyone gets exactly the access they need - no more, no less. It's like having a perfectly organized filing cabinet where everyone knows where their stuff is!
