## Managing Your Personal Profile

Your profile page is where you can personalize your account with your personal information and photo. You can access this page by navigating to `Settings > Account > My Profile` from the main dashboard sidebar.

This page is organized into several key sections that allow you to customize your personal account:

## Profile Photo

The profile photo section is located at the top of the page and displays your current profile picture.

- **Current Photo:** Shows your current profile picture or a placeholder with your initials if no photo is uploaded.
- **Upload Button:** Click this button to select and upload a new profile photo from your computer. The photo will be automatically resized and optimized for the platform.

## Personal Information

This section contains the core details about your account and personal information.

### Full Name

- **Field:** A text input where you can enter or update your full name.
- **Purpose:** This name will be displayed throughout the application and used in communications.
- **Usage:** Simply type your desired name and it will be saved when you click "Save changes."

### Email Address

- **Field:** Displays your current email address.
- **Important Note:** Email addresses cannot be changed directly from this page. If you need to update your email, you'll need to contact support for assistance.
- **Security:** This restriction helps maintain account security and prevents unauthorized email changes.

### Phone Number

- **Field:** A phone number input with country code selection.
- **Country Code:** Click on the country code button (e.g., "BR" for Brazil) to select your country from a dropdown menu.
- **Phone Input:** Enter your phone number in the text field. The format will automatically adjust based on your selected country.
- **Usage:** Phone numbers are used for account verification and can be helpful for support purposes.

## Saving Your Changes

After making any modifications to your profile information:

1.  **Review:** Double-check that all the information you've entered is correct.
2.  **Save:** Click the **"Save changes"** button at the bottom of the form to apply your updates.
3.  **Confirmation:** The system will automatically save your changes and you may see a confirmation message.

## Navigation and Breadcrumbs

The page includes a clear navigation breadcrumb at the top:

- **Settings** → **Account** → **Profile**

This helps you understand where you are in the application and provides quick navigation back to previous sections.

## Additional Account Settings

From this page, you can also access other account-related settings through the left sidebar:

- **Notifications:** Configure your notification preferences and email settings.
- **Security & Access:** Manage your password, two-factor authentication, and account security settings.

Your profile information is automatically synchronized across the platform, so any changes you make here will be reflected throughout your account.
