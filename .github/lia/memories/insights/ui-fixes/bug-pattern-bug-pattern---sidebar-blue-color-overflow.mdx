Encountered and fixed a visual bug where sidebar blue color was overflowing into the dashboard area.

Problem:

- Sidebar blue color was "extravasando" (overflowing) around the dashboard
- User wanted blue limited strictly to sidebar with straight edges

Root Cause:

1. Using variant="inset" on AppSidebar component
2. Sidebar component had rounded corners and floating styles

Solution Applied:

1. Removed variant="inset" from AppSidebar in page.tsx
2. Simplified sidebar div className to remove floating/rounded styles
3. Changed from: "flex h-full w-full flex-col bg-sidebar group-data-[variant=floating]:rounded-lg..."
4. To simply: "flex h-full w-full flex-col bg-sidebar"

Result:

- Sidebar now has straight edges
- Blue color contained within sidebar boundaries
- Clean separation between sidebar and main content area

Files Modified:

- /src/app/dashboard-vendas/page.tsx
- /src/components/ui/sidebar.tsx
