## Managing Your Account Security

The Security & Access page is your central hub for managing all aspects of your account security. You can access this page by navigating to `Settings > Account > Security & Access` from the main dashboard sidebar.

This comprehensive security page is organized into three main sections that help you maintain control over your account access and security settings.

## Connected Accounts

The Connected Accounts section allows you to streamline your login process by connecting your account to external authentication providers.

### Purpose

- **Streamlined Access:** Connect your account to a provider for faster login experiences
- **Single Sign-On:** Use external authentication services for enhanced convenience
- **Security Integration:** Leverage trusted third-party security providers

### Current Status

- **Not Connected:** Your account is currently not connected to any external authentication providers
- **Connect Button:** Click this button to initiate the connection process with supported providers

### Supported Providers

The platform supports connections with various authentication providers, including:

- Google
- GitHub
- Microsoft
- And other OAuth-compatible services

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring a second form of verification beyond your password.

### Purpose

- **Enhanced Security:** Protect your account even if your password is compromised
- **Account Protection:** Prevent unauthorized access through multiple verification steps
- **Industry Standard:** Follow security best practices for sensitive accounts

### Current Status

- **Not Activated:** Two-factor authentication is currently disabled on your account
- **Enable Button:** Click this button to set up 2FA for your account

### Setup Process

When you enable 2FA, you'll typically:

1. **Choose Method:** Select between authenticator apps (like Google Authenticator) or SMS
2. **Scan QR Code:** Use your authenticator app to scan the provided QR code
3. **Verify Setup:** Enter the generated code to confirm the setup
4. **Backup Codes:** Receive backup codes for emergency access

## Manage Sessions

The Manage Sessions section provides comprehensive control over all active sessions across different devices and browsers.

### Purpose

- **Session Overview:** View all devices and browsers currently logged into your account
- **Security Monitoring:** Identify and manage potentially unauthorized access
- **Device Management:** Control which sessions remain active

### Session Information Displayed

Each session shows detailed information:

#### Device Details

- **Operating System:** Shows the OS (e.g., macOS, Windows, Linux)
- **Browser:** Displays the browser name and version (e.g., Chrome 139.0, Safari 16.6)
- **Location:** Indicates the general location of the session (may show "Unknown" for privacy)

#### Session Status

- **Current Session:** Marked as "Current" and cannot be ended
- **Other Devices:** Sessions on other devices that can be terminated
- **Expiration:** Shows when each session will automatically expire

#### Session Management

- **End Session:** Terminate individual sessions on other devices
- **Current Session:** Cannot be ended (disabled button) for your active session

### Example Session Display

```
macOS • Chrome 139.0 • Expires in 03/09/2025, 17:42 • Unknown
[End session] button
```

### Security Benefits

- **Immediate Termination:** End suspicious sessions instantly
- **Access Control:** Limit active sessions to trusted devices only
- **Privacy Protection:** Remove access from shared or public computers

## Navigation and Breadcrumbs

The page includes clear navigation breadcrumbs at the top:

- **Settings** → **Account** → **Security**

This helps you understand your location in the application and provides quick navigation back to previous sections.

## Security Best Practices

To maintain optimal account security:

1. **Enable 2FA:** Always use two-factor authentication when available
2. **Monitor Sessions:** Regularly review active sessions and end suspicious ones
3. **Use Strong Passwords:** Ensure your primary password is strong and unique
4. **Connect Trusted Providers:** Only connect accounts from trusted authentication services
5. **Regular Review:** Periodically review your security settings and connected accounts

## Additional Security Features

From this page, you can also access other security-related settings through the left sidebar:

- **Notifications:** Configure security-related notification preferences

Your security settings are automatically synchronized across the platform, ensuring consistent protection across all your sessions and devices.
