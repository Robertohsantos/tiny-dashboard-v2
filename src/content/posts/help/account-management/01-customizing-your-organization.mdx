## Crafting Your Organization Identity

Let's dive into the core elements that make your workspace uniquely yours:

### Your Visual Identity

<Steps>
### Upload Your Logo
Your logo is your visual signature! Click that "Upload" button and select your brand's logo file. This little image will appear throughout the platform, creating instant brand recognition.

**Pro Tips for Logo Success:**

- Use a high-resolution PNG or SVG for crisp display
- Square or horizontal logos work best
- Keep it simple - it'll appear in various sizes
- Make sure it looks good on both light and dark backgrounds

### Set Your Organization Name

This is your official name as it appears throughout the platform. Whether it's "Acme Corporation," "Sarah's Startup," or "The Innovation Lab," make it memorable and professional.

### Create Your Unique Slug

Your slug is the URL-friendly version of your name (like "acme-corp" or "innovation-lab"). It's automatically generated but fully customizable - make it short, memorable, and brandable!

### Add Contact Information

Include your primary contact email and official website. These details help establish credibility and provide ways for people to connect with your organization.

## Troubleshooting Common Challenges

### Logo Issues

**"My logo looks blurry or pixelated"**

- Upload a higher resolution version (at least 300x300 pixels)
- Use PNG or SVG format for best quality
- Avoid heavily compressed JPEGs

**"My logo doesn't look good on dark backgrounds"**

- Consider creating a version with a white or transparent background
- Test your logo in both light and dark modes
- Sometimes a simple border or drop shadow can help

### Profile Completion

**"I don't have all this information yet"**
That's perfectly fine! Start with what you have and build over time:

- Begin with your name and logo
- Add social profiles as you create them
- Update information as your organization grows

**"Our social media isn't very active"**
Quality beats quantity every time:

- Focus on one platform and do it well
- Share authentic content about your work and culture
- Engage genuinely with your community
- Consistency matters more than frequency
