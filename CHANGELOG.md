### Migration Guide

#### For Existing Projects

1. **Install new dependencies:**

```bash
npm install @tanstack/react-query web-vitals
npm install -D vitest @vitest/coverage-v8 @playwright/test @testing-library/react
```

2. **Add configuration files:**

- Copy `vitest.config.ts`
- Copy `playwright.config.ts`
- Copy `.github/workflows/` directory

3. **Update layout for performance monitoring:**

```typescript
import { RootLayoutWithPerformance } from '@/app/layout-with-performance'

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return <RootLayoutWithPerformance>{children}</RootLayoutWithPerformance>
}
```

4. **Add React Query provider:**

```typescript
import { QueryProvider } from '@/modules/core/providers/query-provider'

export default function App({ children }) {
  return <QueryProvider>{children}</QueryProvider>
}
```

5. **Run tests:**

```bash
npm run test:coverage
npm run test:e2e
```

### Known Issues

- Vitest may show warnings about version mismatch with coverage package
- Playwright requires browsers to be installed: `npx playwright install`
- Web Vitals requires HTTPS in production for accurate measurements
