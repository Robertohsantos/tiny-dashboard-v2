# Purchase List Modal Complete Redesign

## Summary

Successfully redesigned the purchase list modal to match the reference images (dash10.jpeg and dash13.png), implementing a more intuitive and visually appealing layout.

## Major Changes Implemented

### 1. Filter System

- Added dropdown filters for Brands, Suppliers, Categories, and Warehouses
- Implemented "Critical Stock" button for quick filtering
- Added "Clear Filters" button for resetting all selections
- Filters properly cascade and update the product list in real-time

### 2. Statistics Container

- Converted from individual cards to a single unified container
- Statistics now display horizontally without borders
- Shows: Products count, Units to purchase, Estimated value, and Suppliers count
- Cleaner presentation with better visual hierarchy

### 3. Product Row Complete Redesign

- **Line 1**: Checkbox + Product name | SKU | Supplier badge
- **Line 2**: Stock metrics (Current stock, Coverage days, Orders in transit, Daily sales)
- **Line 3**: Visual spacer for better readability
- **Line 4**: Purchase requirements (Gross need, Net need, Suggestion, Purchase input, Estimated value)
- Background color: Light indigo/lilac (bg-indigo-50/20)
- Each row is now ~120px tall for better readability
- Hover and selection states with smooth transitions

### 4. Visual Improvements

- Color-coded coverage indicators (red < 7 days, orange < 14 days)
- Better spacing and padding throughout
- Indigo/lilac color scheme matching reference
- Improved typography with proper font weights

### 5. Footer Reorganization

- "Unselect All" button on the left
- Selected count display next to unselect button
- "Back", "Cancel", and "Generate Purchase Order" buttons on the right

## Technical Implementation

- Used Radix UI Select components for dropdowns

- Memoized calculations for performance
- Type-safe implementation with TypeScript
- Responsive design considerations

## Result
