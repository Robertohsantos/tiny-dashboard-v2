Successfully implemented a clean separation between development mock data and production data fetching for the dashboard-vendas page.

Key changes:

1. Created /src/mocks/ directory for all mock data (dashboard-data.json, chart-data.json, metrics-data.json)
2. Implemented conditional data fetching in /src/modules/dashboard/data/data-fetchers.ts based on NODE_ENV
3. Updated all dashboard components to receive data via props instead of hardcoded values
4. Added TypeScript interfaces for type safety

Result: In development, mock data is loaded from JSON files. In production, the system is ready to fetch from database (Prisma queries to be implemented).
