# DropdownMenu Click Handlers Fix

## Problem

The Ferramentas and Colunas dropdown buttons were not working properly. Additionally, there was an SSE error showing in the dev server.

## Root Cause

1. The DropdownMenuItem components were using `onClick` instead of `onSelect`
2. Missing event.preventDefault() in handlers
3. The SSE error "ERR_INVALID_STATE" is unrelated - it's a Next.js hot reload issue

## Solution Applied

1. Changed from `onClick` to `onSelect` in all DropdownMenuItem components
2. Added `e.preventDefault()` to prevent default behavior
3. Added `sideOffset={5}` to DropdownMenuContent for better positioning

## Code Changes

```tsx
// Before
<DropdownMenuItem onClick={handleFunction}>

// After
<DropdownMenuItem onSelect={(e) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  handleFunction()
}}>
```

## Additional Notes

The SSE (Server-Sent Events) error is a common Next.js development server issue related to the hot reload mechanism. It doesn't affect the functionality of the application and can be safely ignored in development.

## Result

Both dropdown menus (Ferramentas and Colunas) now work correctly with proper event handling.
