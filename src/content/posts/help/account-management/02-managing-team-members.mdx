  Great teams don't just happen - they're built with intention, clear

## Your Team Management Hub

Think of the Team Members page as your mission control center. Head to `Settings > Organization > Members` and you'll find everything you need to build and manage your collaborative workspace.

This is where the magic happens - you can see your entire crew, invite new talent, and make sure everyone has exactly the right level of access to do their best work.

## Bringing New Heroes Aboard ðŸš€

Ready to expand your team? Inviting someone new is easier than ordering coffee online!

<Steps>
### Find the Magic Button
Look for that bright **Invite Member** button in the top right. It's your gateway to team expansion!

### Share the Details

A friendly dialog will pop up asking for:

- Their email address (make sure it's correct - we can't deliver to typos!)
- The role that fits their responsibilities
- Any personal message you'd like to include

### Send the Invitation

Hit that **Send Invitation** button and voilÃ ! They'll receive a personalized email with everything they need to join your workspace.

### Welcome Your New Teammate

Once they accept, they'll appear in your member list, ready to contribute to your shared success!

</Steps>

<Callout type="success" title="Invitation Best Practice">
  When inviting someone, take a moment to explain their role and how they'll
  contribute to the team. A warm welcome message goes a long way in making new
  members feel valued from day one!
</Callout>

## Understanding Team Roles: The Perfect Balance

Every great team needs structure. Think of roles like positions on a sports team - everyone has their strengths and responsibilities. Here's how our role system works:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Owner - The Captain">

**The Ultimate Decision Maker**

This is you - the founder, the visionary, the person with the master key to everything! As the Owner, you have complete control over:

- Organization settings and branding
- Billing and subscription management
- Adding and removing team members
- Deleting the organization (use this power wisely!)
- Everything an Admin can do, and more

<Callout type="info" title="One Captain Per Ship">
  There can only be one Owner per organization. This ensures clear
  accountability and prevents conflicts over critical decisions.
</Callout>

</Tab>

<Tab title="Admin - The Trusted Lieutenant">

**Your Right-Hand Person**

Admins are your trusted team leaders who can handle most day-to-day management tasks:

- Manage team members (invite, remove, change roles)
- Configure organization settings
- Oversee projects and workflows
- Access all workspace features
- Everything a Member can do, plus management powers

What they **can't** do:

- Delete the organization
- Manage billing information
- Change the Owner

<Callout type="tip" title="Admin Strategy">
  Choose Admins who understand your vision and can make decisions in your
  absence. They're your organizational backbone!
</Callout>

</Tab>

<Tab title="Member - The Contributors">

**The Heart of Your Team**

Members are the talented individuals who bring your vision to life:

- Access all workspace features and tools
- Collaborate on projects and tasks
- Create and manage their own content
- Participate in team discussions
- View most organizational information

What they **can't** do:

- Change organization settings
- Manage other team members
- Access billing information
- Modify security settings

<Callout type="note" title="Member Focus">
  Members can focus entirely on their work without worrying about organizational
  management. This clarity helps them be more productive and creative!
</Callout>

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Managing Your Current Team

Your member list is more than just names and emails - it's your team dashboard! Here's how to make the most of it:

### What You Can See at a Glance

<Columns>
<Column>

**Member Information**

- Full name and profile picture
- Email address for contact
- Current role and permissions
- Join date and activity status

</Column>
<Column>

**Quick Actions**

- Change member roles instantly
- Send direct messages or notifications
- Remove members when necessary
- View individual activity and contributions

</Column>
</Columns>

### Making Changes Safely

When you need to modify team access:

<Accordion>
<Panel title="Changing Member Roles">
Need to promote someone or adjust their permissions?

1. Find their name in the member list
2. Click the role dropdown next to their name
3. Select the new role that fits their responsibilities
4. Confirm the change

The change takes effect immediately, and they'll be notified of their new permissions.

</Panel>

<Panel title="Removing Team Members">
Sometimes people move on, and that's okay! Here's how to handle departures gracefully:

1. Click the options menu (â‹¯) next to their name
2. Select "Remove from organization"
3. Confirm that you want to proceed
4. Optionally, send them a farewell message

<Callout type="warning" title="Important Note">
You cannot remove the Owner. If ownership needs to transfer, contact our support team for assistance with the process.
</Callout>
</Panel>

<Panel title="Handling Role Conflicts">
If you're unsure about what role someone should have:

- **Start conservative**: Begin with Member role and promote as needed
- **Consider their responsibilities**: Match permissions to actual job functions
- **Review regularly**: People's roles evolve, and permissions should too
- **Communicate clearly**: Make sure everyone understands their access level
    </Panel>
</Accordion>

## Pro Tips for Team Harmony

Here are some insider secrets for building an amazing collaborative environment:

### Communication is Key

- **Set expectations early**: Explain roles and responsibilities during onboarding
- **Regular check-ins**: Make sure everyone feels heard and valued
- **Clear boundaries**: Help team members understand what they can and can't access

### Security Best Practices

- **Regular audits**: Review team access quarterly to ensure it's still appropriate
- **Prompt removal**: When someone leaves, remove their access immediately
- **Role hygiene**: Don't give more permissions than necessary

### Building Culture

- **Welcome new members**: Create a warm onboarding experience
- **Celebrate achievements**: Recognize contributions at all levels
- **Encourage collaboration**: Foster an environment where everyone feels comfortable contributing

<Callout type="tip" title="Growing Teams">
  As your team grows, consider creating [clear
  documentation](/help/account-management/managing-your-profile) about roles and
  responsibilities. This helps new members understand the landscape quickly!
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

Every team faces challenges. Here's how to handle the most common situations:

### "I invited someone but they can't access certain features"

Check their role! Members have different permissions than Admins. If they need broader access, consider promoting their role or adjusting your organization settings.

### "Someone left but I can't remove them from the list"

Make sure you have Admin or Owner permissions. If you're trying to remove the Owner, that requires a special process - contact our support team for help.

### "My team is getting too big to manage"

Consider promoting trusted members to Admin status to help with management duties. You can also organize teams using [our advanced organization features](/help/account-management/customizing-your-organization).

### "I accidentally gave someone the wrong role"

No worries! Role changes are instant and reversible. Simply adjust their role using the dropdown menu next to their name.

## Ready to Scale Your Success?

Managing team members isn't just about access control - it's about creating an environment where talented people can do their best work together. With clear roles, smooth processes, and good communication, your team will be unstoppable!
